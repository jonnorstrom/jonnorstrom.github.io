        Version control. Control over all previous versions of your work. And entire library of versions. I hope I've made my point clear - it's important. Think of when you were making a poster board for your highschool science fair and it got to the point where you needed to start writing on the board in pen or permanent marker. You are seriously puttin it all on the line. I sure hope you don't mess up. Version control is the opposite of that. Let's say you decide to work smart and print things off - paste paper to your poster board and so on. If something goes wrong it's pretty easy to fix only that issue, and go back to where your 'bug' is. Now <strong>that</strong> is version control. I hope you can see why this is important - using version control for your development projects, graphic design projects, text written projects, etc. is always a smart work practice.

        Git allows you to track your changes because you can simply make a new branch and then work on that branch. If things go wrong you can always go back to before than branch and so forth. This is git's version of version control.

        Lastly, Github. Github is an online library of seemingly unlimited amounts of source code, developers asking for help and developers offering help. Using git and Github together makes a seamless transition from your terminal to online. You can store your code here and allow others to evaulate it, allow your team to approve of it, etc. All of this open-source awesomeness is just cool to be around. Use Github.
