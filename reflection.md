##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
- I learned that it's a total pain. But with some dedication and a lot of patience it eventually all comes together. Throughout this challenge I was able to begin to differentiate between the three pretty well!

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
- I learned that it takes much more time than I expected. I still don't feel like I know how to use 'display' or 'positon' very well but I'll have to learn some more about them in my own time.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
- The nav bar I though was pretty easy, but getting divs beside each other appropriately was pretty difficult.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
- I learned that classes and Id's are really important and I learned to format my CSS page in order with my HTML page.
